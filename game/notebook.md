## Notes
*Use this space to record your findings and deductions...*


1. A note from The Mayor mentions witnessing something concerning near the dock.
2. Go back and check the storage in the shops.
3. Go back and check the market in the shops.
4. Go back and check the offices in the town hall.
5. Go to the gazebo in the park.
6. At last! This untouched crime scene reveals the truth. No one has been here since the incident.

Your careful detective work has paid off. The empty state of this room matches
witness accounts - no one was around when the crime occurred. This must be
where the murderer carried out their plan!

Make sure to document this discovery in your notebook.md file along with your
other findings about the weapon and suspect.

Location of the crime is still unknown - the room must have been empty when it happened...
