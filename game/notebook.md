## Notes
*Use this space to record your findings and deductions...*


1. A note from The Mayor mentions witnessing something concerning near the dock.

2. 
3. At last! This untouched crime scene reveals the truth. No one has been here since the incident.

Your careful detective work has paid off. The empty state of this room matches
witness accounts - no one was around when the crime occurred. This must be
where the murderer carried out their plan!

Make sure to document this discovery in your notebook.md file along with your
other findings about the weapon and suspect.


3.New Clue:

Go back and check the storage in the shops.

Hint: You'll need to go back several directories to reach this location.
Remember that you can use multiple '../' to go up multiple levels:
- 'cd ..'    goes up one level
- 'cd ../..' goes up two levels
- and so on...


4. Go back and check the market in the shops.

Location of the crime is still unknown - the room must have been empty when it happened...
